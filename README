Graph Learning Notes:

1. Add DFS and BFS functions with start node specification, rather than try to construct whole graph.
List<Node<T>> graphDfs(Node<T> startNode);

2. Reverse Adj list can be kept to determine roots for graph.
```
        Set<Node<String>> startNodes = graphAdjacency
                .keySet()
                .stream()
                .filter(node -> reverseAdjacency.get(node) == null)
                .collect(Collectors.toSet());
```

3. Element should be removed from Queue or Stack only if can be processed immediately, otherwise use peek().

4. If we do pre-order in DFS, iterative logic is simpler because we do not need to keep track if new nodes got added to stack or not.



TODO:

1. Problems to solve
* Prefix, postfix, infix notation
* algo to generate prime numbers
* pre generate prime numbers to optimize isprime

2. Low Priority:
* Code formatting settings for intellij java projects.
    - Integrate checkstyle.
    - Integrate findbugs.
