//7 -Given a pond where all the stones are lined at a distance of one unit (C in each row and there are R such rows), 
//each stone has a special value which denotes the length of the jump the frog can make i.e
//if frog is on stone (x,y) and value is k then frog can jump to (x+dx, y+dy) where dx+dy=k and frog doesnt leave the bounds.
//Find the minimum number of jumps to reach the stone at (R,C).
