//Sample
//Questions
//Personal Interview I / Machine Coding Round Questions :-
//if a string length is big enough, so that it cannot be printed in single line, use - in the end of the line and print string further in the different line.
//also there should not be consecutively in the end, if the string contains already -in the end don't put - character.
//E.g. flip-kart and if x = 5 so it should be ->
//flip-
//kart
//the string should not start with these characters(. , ,  )
//the cost value should be minimum, there can not be multiple answer for a single string.
//E.g.. This is a flipkartonline programming test.
//x = 10 Y = 3
//Output
//This is a
//flipkart
//online pr-
//ogramming
//test.
